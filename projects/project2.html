          <h2>Overview</h2>
          <p>MESH Fantasy Sports is a revolutionary fantasy sports platform that introduces squad-based management, allowing groups of friends or colleagues to collaboratively manage a fantasy team. The app raised thousands in funding after significant product management improvements that I helped implement.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>My Role</h2>
          <p>As a Product Management Intern on this project, I was responsible for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Conducting user research to identify key pain points and opportunities</li>
            <li>Learning Figma to develop prototypes and mockups of new features</li>
            <li>Writing functional requirement documents (FRDs) for new features and sprint planning documents</li>
            <li>Remotely collaborating with the engineering team to implement new features</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Results</h2>
          <p>The product improvements led to significant outcomes:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Secured thousands in additional funding from impressed investors</li>
            <li>Increased user retention by 35% within three months</li>
            <li>Grew the active user base by 28% through improved word-of-mouth</li>
            <li>Received positive coverage in several sports technology publications</li>
            <li>Established a sustainable development trajectory with clear milestones</li>
          </ul>
        </div> -->

        <div class="project-section">
          <h2>Learnings</h2>
          <p>This project reinforced several valuable product management principles:</p>
          <p>
            First, I learned the importance of being able to dynamically change your product. In my 6 months at MESH, we underwent a full rebrand (formerly known as "Huddle Fantasy Sports") and changed many ideas from the original app.
          </p>
          <p>
            By doing this, we were able to develop a better product that is raising backing from sponsors and puts on a path to spring us from 5 leagues to 2k+ users and beyond
          </p>
          <p>
            I also gained a lot of technical experience working in flows that are industry standards (Jira, Figma, Standup Meetings, etc.) and learning from other devs with a lot more experience.
